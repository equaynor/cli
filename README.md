# RootnRise

Welcome,

RootnRise strives to inform people of color about an ancient egyptian yoga system called Kemetic Yoga. The website is intended to create an online presence for Tasha Quaynor, a certified "Basu" - a teacher of this practice, helping her offer Yoga classes, expand her member base and build a community.
