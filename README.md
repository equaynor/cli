# RootnRise
## Code Institute - First Milestone Project: User Centric Frontend Development.

Welcome,

RootnRise strives to inform people of color about an ancient egyptian yoga system called Kemetic Yoga. The website is intended to create an online presence for my wife Tasha Quaynor, a certified "Basu" - a teacher of this practice, helping her offer Yoga classes, expand her member base and build a community.
For the bipoc community it offers the chance to touch upon to their ancestral wisdom, connecting to their african roots, joining their tribe while boosting their health and wellbeing.

  * The navigation bar is at the top of the page, and it is fixed to the top. The logo is in the left-hand corner of the navigation, and it links to the index.html page. 
  * The other navigation links on the website are to the right. Kemetic Yoga, Classes, About Me, Testamonials, and Join connect to different sections of the same page.
  * The font color is in contrast with the navigation background color. The hover effect is used for navigation, so the user can know which page they are on. 
  * The navigation bar turns into a burger menu on mobile devices for a better user experience.
